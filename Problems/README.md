# Deliverables

1. All Matlab or C++ files should be submitted in a zip file with name “LastNameFEMProject.zip”.
2. The output file corresponding to the truss problem shown in section 3.3. RunName = Truss. Input file is shown in that section and can also be downloaded from: http://rezaabedi.com/wp-content/uploads/Courses/FEM/Truss.txt.
3. From Reference [1]: Input File and output File for Figure 22.4 (also shown in figure 1(a)). RunName = TrussExt.
4. From Reference [1]: Input File and output File for Exercise 22.3 (also shown in figure 1(b)). All geometry and material parameters are provided in the reference [2] page 22-12
    > The SI physical units to be used are: mm for lengths, N for forces, and MPa=N/mm2 for elastic moduli. For the calculations use the following numerical data: L = 10, 000 mm (10 m), H = 6, 000 (6 m), a = 500mm (0.5 m), P = 4, 800 N, E = 35, 000 MPa (high strength concrete). The member cross section area is A = a^2, and the flexural moment of inertia about the neutral axis is Izz = a^4/12
    RunName = FrameExt.
5. From Reference [1]: Exercise 22.4 (A concept question about Exercise 22.3). The question
is as follows: Do we capture the exact solution for the frame problem in figure 1(b)? Justify
your answer (why we (do not) obtain the exact solution).
